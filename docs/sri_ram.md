# Sri Ram and His Beliefs?
* *Sri Ram* is considered by Hindus as a perfect man and his wife *Sita* as an ambodiment of perfect womanhood.
* Many Hindus believe that *Sri Ram* is an *avatar* of Lord *Vishnu*.
	* *Avatar* comes from *Av* (down) & *Tra* (to passover) which means 'to descend down'. Some scholars say that it means 'descent of a man who is in special relationship with GOD'.
	* *Vishnu* means '*The Sustainer*' which is another name of All Mighty GOD according to Hindu Scriptures [[Concept of God in Hinduism](http://a5221985.github.io/seeking_the_truth_site/site/concept_of_god_in_hinduism/)]. 
	* Therefore *Sri Ram* was a man sent by All Mighty God (as per the concept of Avatar)
* But many Hindus also believe that *Sri Ram* is All Mighty GOD, descended to earth in the form of a man. 
* In fact *Sri Ram* never claimed divinity. He never said that he is Almighty GOD. On the contrary, he said the following
	1. > "**Atmaanam kaarushyamanye Ramam Dasharathaatmajam**" (I am just an `ordinary human being`, I am `Dasharatha's son`) [Ramayanam, Sundarakanda]
* When *Sri Ram* was asleep, his *Guru* (Teacher) *Vishwamithra* woke him up with the following song
	1. > "**Kausalya supraja Rama purva sandhya pravarthate, uthishta narashardhula, Karthavyam daiva maanhikam**" (Oh Rama! Kausalya's endearing son! it is time of dawn. wake up! oh tiger among men! worshipping All Mighty GOD is the objective of your life) [Ramayanam, Balakanda]
* We also find that *Sri Ram* remembered All Mighty GOD before shooting an arrow in a battle field.

#### Conclusion
* We can come to the following conclusion that, *Sri Ram* never claimed divinity but he himself worshiped All Mighty GOD according to Hindu scriptures.
